# Use vscode to write python

 As an easy-to-use lightweight code editor, it supports code debugging,with rich plug-in library, and free to obtain. Thus,it is suitable for us to write python


## Extionsion
- [x] python
- [x] vscode-icons
- [x] Theme
  - [x] One Dark Pro
  - [x] Brackets Light Pro
  - [x] Monikai Pro
- [x] filesize
- [ ] Anaconda Extension Pack

## Environment Set up
  We can use conda to create a new envs,and set the python path of this envs. 
```python
>>> conda create -n asrEnv python=3
>>> conda activate asrEnv
>>> conda deactivate 
```
- In my opinion, Jupyter Lab or PyCharm is better than Vscode in the construction of big production. 
- This notebook is just for recoding
